# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
- **Program Schedule**: The project must adhere to the fixed timeline of the CDSP program, including milestones and submission deadlines.
- **Curriculum Requirements**: The project must align with the learning objectives and technical focus areas defined by the MIT CDSP curriculum, particularly in Python programming, data analysis, and computational thinking.
- **Assessment Criteria**: The project will be evaluated based on predefined rubrics covering code quality, problem-solving approach, collaboration, and documentation.
- **Resource Accessibility**: Our tools are limited to those approved or provided by the program (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks, GitHub Classroom, MITx platforms) and publicly available libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).
- **Time Zone Differences**: Team members are geographically dispersed across continents, requiring asynchronous collaboration and careful scheduling of synchronous meetings.


## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
- **Diverse Skill Levels**: Team members possess different levels of proficiency in Python, data visualization, statistics, and collaborative tools like GitHub.
- **Limited Availability**: Each member is balancing this project alongside other responsibilities such as work, school, or personal obligations, reducing total time available for active development.
- **Language Proficiency**: As participants come from diverse backgrounds, some team members may face difficulties with technical communication or documentation due to English being a second language.
- **Technical Constraints**: Some members may only have access to low-spec computers or limited internet bandwidth, which affects performance when handling large datasets or using heavy libraries.


## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
- **Coding Standards**: The team agrees to follow PEP 8 for Python and include meaningful comments to ensure code clarity and maintainability.
- **Version Control**: GitHub will be used for all code collaboration, with a workflow involving feature branches, pull requests, and peer reviews.
- **Communication Protocols**: Daily check-ins will be handled asynchronously via Slack, while weekly meetings will be held on Zoom to align on progress and blockers.
- **Task Management**: Agile methodology will guide our work, using Trello boards to assign and track tasks in 2â€“3 day sprints with regular backlog grooming.
- **Project Scope**: To remain within time and resource limits, the team will focus on a well-defined use case (e.g., building a predictive model using public datasets), avoiding feature creep.
- **Learning Objectives**: The project is designed to prioritize the application of core concepts such as data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and model evaluation over implementation complexity or large-scale deployment.
